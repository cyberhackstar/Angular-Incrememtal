. The Chocolate Experiment

A teacher once gave each student a piece of chocolate and told them, "If you wait for 10 minutes without eating it, you'll get another one."

Half the students ate their chocolate immediately. The other half resisted the temptation and got rewarded with an extra chocolate.

Years later, researchers found that the students who waited were more successful in life because they had better self-control and patience.
